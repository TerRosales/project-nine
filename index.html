            <h1>Terrence <span>Rosales</span></h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in Northern Philippines. I grew where beaches are just a walk away and snow didn't exist, but we had our famous Halo-Halo and our Sago't Gulamans, they do a very good job of satiating our cold cravings. Another fact about myself is I have a very strong grasp of my artistic expressability, and I also love seeing graphical representation of all these art.</p>

            <h3>Rosy Rosales</h3>
            <p>A Woman that captured my attention ever since the day I have met her. Life has been a blessing being able to grow with someone that I be myself around with and to be with someone that has similar food language as I do. She has given three beautiful children and I cherish every single day that passes. It has a bliss knowing someone will always be there to support and to life you up, with or without the challenges.</p>
